# zen

A sleek and minimalist Zen theme for Twiglight, designed to emulate the Arc UX theme while consolidating all elements into the sidebar. My mission with this project is to replicate the Arc feel and UX as much as possible while still keeping the Zen touch.

## Setup

1. Open `about:profiles` in your browser.
2. Search for the profile that says `This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted.`
3. Click on `Show in file explorer` for the Root Directory
4. Look for a folder called `chrome` if it does not exist create it
5. Download the [`userChrome.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0PandaDEV/zen/refs/heads/main/userChrome.css) from this repo and place it inside that folder. If there is already a userChrome.css file check its contents and maybe just paste the new content in there instead of replacing the file.
6. Now restart Zen and the theme should be installed.
